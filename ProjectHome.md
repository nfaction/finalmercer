Reuben (Rube) Goldberg began life as an engineer. However, as with most engineers, his other
interests prevailed and he became a professional cartoonist. Rube began producing syndicated cartoons
in 1915 and continued through most of his remaining life. In 1948, he was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for
his political cartoons.
What brought Goldberg the most fame was his series of cartoons featuring Professor Lucifer
Gorgonzola Butts. The premise of these cartoons was the professor’s use of overly complicated
contraptions to perform otherwise simple tasks. The below example is a “Self‐Operating Napkin”, which,
through a series of physical reactions, passes a napkin across the user’s face (which may be substituted
for a harmonica to provide after‐dinner entertainment.)
